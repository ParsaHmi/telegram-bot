# TELEGRAM BOT

Welcome to my GitHub! This is a simple sample project for making your own Telegram bot and customizing it. For example, I made a Telegram bot that reminds Mirror Times in my own channel. Here's how I built it:

## python
- **checkconnection.py**: In this file, you just need to place your bot API token and run it. It will attempt to connect to your bot and notify you if there’s any issue.

- **bot.py**: This is the main code that reminds the time. To run it:
1- First, you need to install the required library:
```cmd
pip install python-telegram-bot
```
2- Then, create your bot and channel, place your bot API token and channel ID in the code.
3- run the code to start your bot !

and then make your own bot and channel , put your bot API and channel ID in the code and run it !

## node.js
Many servers don’t support Python, so I also created a Node.js version of the bot :)

## ATTENTION 
This code needs to be continuously running for your bot to work properly. The recommended way is to host this code on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to keep it running without interruption.

Now you can have your own Telegram bot! Good luck!
